## 📖 About the Project

Trip Planner Frontend is a **static web app** designed as a foundation for trip planning UI/UX. It contains:
- An organized `index.html` file, featuring the main planner interface.
- A visually appealing trip image (`trip image.jpg`) that can be used for backgrounds, banners, or cards.
- A `.gitignore` file for repository hygiene, should you wish to extend the project.

---

## 📸 Demo

You can preview the app by simply downloading or cloning the repository, and opening `index.html` in your web browser.

## ✨ Features

- **Single-File Deployment:** All logic and content resides in one HTML file for easy access and sharing.
- **Customizable Visuals:** Incorporate your own images, or use the included banner as a cover photo or section illustration.
- **Responsive Layout (if implemented):** Looks great on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Simple User Flow:** Minimal distractions, letting you focus on planning.
